				<h2>More about me</h2>
				<p>
					My name is <strong>Alan Romero</strong>. I have a strong
					foundation in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>,
					and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, which I've honed through
					various projects and personal pursuits. I believe that the
					ability to create visually appealing and functional websites
					is a crucial aspect of modern business, and I'm eager to
					contribute to that field.
				</p>

				<p>
					I'm particularly interested in developing responsive
					websites that offer an exceptional user experience. I enjoy
					working on both the
					<strong>front-end</strong> and
					<strong>back-end</strong> aspects of web development, and
					I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay
					up-to-date with the latest technologies.
					<strong
						>My ultimate goal is to become a valuable member of a
						web development team</strong
					>
					and collaborate with others to create innovative solutions.
				</p>

				<p>
					Thanks for taking the time to learn a bit about me and my
					aspirations. I'm excited to continue my journey as a web
					developer and see where it takes me!
